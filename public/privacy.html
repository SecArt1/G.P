        <ul>
            <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data storage (e.g., Google Firebase Firestore), data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.

        <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. We utilize Google Firebase services, which employ industry-standard security measures. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>

        <h2>7. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. (Adjust if applicable).</p>

        <h2>8. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>(Detail rights based on user location, e.g., GDPR rights like access, rectification, erasure, portability; CCPA rights). You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time by logging into your account settings or contacting us.</p>
